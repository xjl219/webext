P. F. Chang's Mongolian Beef
from:http://www.food.com/recipe/p-f-changs-mongolian-beef-66121
Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 tablespoon garlic, chopped
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
vegetable oil, for frying (about 1 cup)
1 lb flank steak
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 large green onions, sliced on the diagonal into one-inch lengths
Directions:
1Make the sauce by heating 2 tsp of vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over med/low heat.
2Don't get the oil too hot.
3Add ginger and garlic to the pan and quickly add the soy sauce and water before the garlic scorches.
4Dissolve the brown sugar in the sauce, then raise the heat to about medium and boil the sauce for 2-3 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
5Remove it from the heat.
6Slice the flank steak against the grain into 1/4" thick bite-size slices (Tilt the blade of your knife at about a forty five degree angle to the top of the steak so that you get wider cuts).
7Dip the steak pieces into the cornstarch to apply a very thin dusting to both sides of each piece of beef.
8Let the beef sit for about 10 minutes so that the cornstarch sticks.
9As the beef sits, heat up one cup of oil in a wok (you may also use a skillet for this step as long as the beef will be mostly covered with oil).
10Heat the oil over medium heat until it's nice and hot, but not smoking.
11Add the beef to the oil and saut¨¦ for just two minutes, or until the beef just begins to darken on the edges.
12You don't need a thorough cooking here since the beef is going to go back on the heat later.
13Stir the meat around a little so that it cooks evenly.
14After a couple minutes, use a large slotted spoon to take the meat out and onto paper towels, then pour the oil out of the wok or skillet.
15Put the pan back over the heat, dump the meat back into it and simmer for one minute.
16Add the sauce, cook for one minute while stirring, then add all the green onions.
17Cook for one more minute, then remove the beef and onions with tongs or a slotted spoon to a serving plate.
18Leave the excess sauce behind in the pan.
