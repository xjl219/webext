Broiled Fish with Shiitake Red Rice Pilaf
from:http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/recipe/broiled-fish-shiitake-red-rice-pilaf
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1/2 cup chopped yellow onion
1 cup chopped stemmed shiitake mushrooms
1 cup uncooked Bhutanese red rice
1 3/4 cup chicken or vegetable broth
1 bay leaf
4 (4- to 6-ounce) tilapia, flounder or Dover sole fillets
Salt and pepper to taste
1 small orange, very thinly sliced
Directions:
1.Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onions and mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are translucent and mushrooms have wilted, about 5 minutes.
2.Add rice and toast, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broth and bay leaf, stir well, bring to a boil and then cover. Reduce heat to low and simmer until all of the moisture is absorbed, about 40 minutes. Set pot aside off of the heat, covered, for 15 minutes; remove and discard bay leaf and fluff rice with a fork. Set aside, uncovered.
3.Arrange a rack about 8 inches from the heating element in your oven; preheat broiler. Arrange fish on an oiled foil-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. Broil until almost cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide orange slices among the fillets, arranging them over the top of each and return to the oven. Broil until fish is cooked through and oranges are deep golden brown around edges, 2 to 3 minutes more.
4.Spoon pilaf onto plates and top with fillets. Serve immediately.
