Ingredients:
3 tbsp. butter
1/2 lb. carrots (about 2 lg.), washed & thinly sliced
1 med. onion, thinly sliced
1 qt. (4 c.) chicken stock
1/4 c. long grain rice
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. freshly ground white pepper
1 c. whipping cream
1 tbsp. minced fresh parsley (garnish)
Directions:
Melt butter in heavy 3 quart saucepan over low heat. Add carrot and onion, cover and cook about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Stir in stock, rice, salt and pepper.
Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to processor or blender in batches and puree. Return to saucepan. Stir in cream (if soup is too thick, thin with stock or water). Place over low heat and simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning and serve. 6 to 8 servings.
