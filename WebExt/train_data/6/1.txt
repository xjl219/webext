dish name:
Cape Cod Cranberry Meatloaf
from:http://www.recipegirl.com/2012/11/05/cape-cod-cranberry-meatloaf/
Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole cranberry sauce
1/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 pounds ground beef (I used 85% lean)
1/2 cup milk
1 small onion, finely chopped (about 3/4 cup)
1/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 to 4 whole bay leaves
additional fresh thyme sprig
Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°„F. Lightly oil a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. In a small bowl, combine the cranberry sauce and brown sugar.
2. Place the cranberry sauce mixture in the bottom of the prepared loaf pan.
3. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients (except bay leaves and thyme sprig) and mix well. Set the meat loaf mixture in the pan on top of the sauce.
4. Top the loaf with bay leaves and thyme sprig and bake 1 1/2 hours or until cooked through. **Place a rimmed pan on the rack under the loaf to catch any excess drippings (and line that pan with foil if you want easy clean up!)
5. Allow the loaf to cool for 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprig. Very carefully use a spatula to scoop underneath the meatloaf and move it to a serving plate. Drizzle some of the pan juices over the loaf.
