dish name:
Sweet and sour duck broth
from:http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sweet_and_sour_duck_33242
Ingredients:
leftover duck carcass from a roast duck, remaining meat picked and set aside
30g/1oz dried wild mushrooms
thumb-sized piece ginger, chopped
8 peppercorns
1 bay leaf
vegetable or groundnut oil
2 garlic cloves
2 spring onions
2 tbsp golden caster sugar
3 tbsp sherry vinegar
1 pak choi 
Directions:
Place the duck carcass in a large pan and cover with water.
Add the dried mushrooms, chopped ginger, peppercorns and bay leaf. Bring just to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for an hour.
Heat a splash of oil in a separate pan and fry the garlic, spring onions until softened. Add any leftover duck meat to the pan and heat through.
Add the sugar and vinegar and cook for two minutes.
Strain the duck broth through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Add the pak choi and the duck mixture at the last minute so the pak choi is just wilted. Ladle into deep bowls.
